# Week 2 - Genomic Data

Welcome to week 2 of Exploring the Bacterial Genome with Data Science! The first two steps of any data science project should be: 1. Understand the subject area, speak to experts and review research in the field to formulate a research question, 2. look for possible sources of data, understand what is available, in what formats and any potential biases in that information. 

Last week we covered 1. the high level overview of the subject area and research question and so this week we'll be focusing on 2. the data understanding and gathering step. During this workshop you'll learn about the formats and types of data available when working with bacterial genomes and AMR testing and where you can go to find publicly available datasets to work with.

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the basics of AMR testing, the data formats and limitations
2. Understand the basics of sequencing methods and the types of data available to work with
3. Learn where to find publicly available data and how to access it
4. Perform initial data processing to transform into a usable format for further explorations

### Session Timeline 

- Overview of bacterial & genomic data
- Data gathering tutorial
- Genomic Alignment Exercise (Assignment)

### Follow up Exercises

- This week has an optional (although highly encouraged) exercise to take the data you downloaded during class and subset a few assembly sequences down to just the relevant genes (using the CARD data)
- The exercise is designed to take up to an hour to complete
- You'll need to have a Biopython installation working to complete this exercise - if you cannot install Biopython feel free to skip this exercise and just read the solution
- The fully processed data will be provided next week 
- Alignment & working with BAM files is a common bioinformatics process and so this exercise will be useful if you're interested in further understanding and working with these techniques

### Office Hours 

If you have any further questions or wish to clarify anything discussed during the workshop, please reach out and schedule a slot during office hours to discuss.
