# Week 1 - Project Introduction & Setup

Welcome to week 1 of Exploring the Bacterial Genome with Data Science! This first session will introduce the aims and purposes of the project and get you up to speed with the background and context required to succeed during the next 8 weeks. 

### Learning Objectives

1. Meet your teaching fellow and the students you'll be working with for your cohort, introduce yourself.
2. Understand the context for the project - why do we care about Bacterial Genomes? What is AMR? How can Data Science help?
3. Set up your environment for future sessions (Github, Python, Conda, Biopython)
4. Ask any questions or clarifications regarding the upcoming project and expectations
