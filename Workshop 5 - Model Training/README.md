# Week 5 - Model Training Approaches

Welcome to week 5 of Exploring the Bacterial Genome with Data Science! Now that we've finished exploring and transforming out data into clean, consistent features, we can start trying out a few different ML approaches for making our predictions.

We have three potential feature options that we've already looked at and will be using in this session:
1. Presence absence of genes
2. Kmers of gene sequences
3. Raw sequences of genes

### Learning Objectives

1. Learn how to specify and train a few different types of machine learning model
2. Understanding how to set up data for training and leverage cross validation

### Session Timeline 

- Model Training Approaches
- Model building tutorial
- Introduction to Final Project

### Follow up Exercises

- There is no assignment for this week but we'll be kicking off the final projects (full details in the Final Project Readme in the main folder).
- The project will run for three weeks with a presentation on week 8
- There is a fairly minimal set of criteria to complete the project but plenty of additional scope should you wish to dive in further.


### Office Hours 

If you have any further questions or wish to clarify anything discussed during the workshop, please reach out and schedule a slot during office hours to discuss.
