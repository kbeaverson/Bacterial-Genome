# Week 6 - Model Tuning & Optimization

Welcome to week 6 of Exploring the Bacterial Genome with Data Science! With a few different model options reviewed and explored, the next step is to make sure we're getting the most performance out of those models.

A few of the model types we've reviewed:
- Linear models (logistic regression)
- Tree based models (decision trees & random forest)
- Boosting (adaboost, xgboost)
- Neural networks

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the purpose and objectives of model optimization and selection
2. Review a few different approaches to hyperparameter searching
3. Recap cross-validation and expand to nested cross validation

### Session Timeline 

- Model tuning Overview
- Model optimization approach & nested cross validation
- Model tuning tutorial

### Follow up Exercises

- This week's assignment is to continue working on the final project
- Try introducing model optimization and nested CV into your workflow
- Use the Kaggle competition to get a final score for your model


### Office Hours 

If you have any further questions or wish to clarify anything discussed during the workshop, please reach out and schedule a slot during office hours to discuss.
