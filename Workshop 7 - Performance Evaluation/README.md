# Week 7 - Performance Evaluation

Welcome to week 7 of Exploring the Bacterial Genome with Data Science! The final step of our data science process is to review and present the outcome from our modeling problem. We've explored a number of different models and approaches, tried different parameters and model training procedures. How are we going to summarize and present this to stakeholders though?

A few areas to consider:
- What metrics do we want to review and present?
- How are we going to discuss confidence and uncertainty?
- How do we wish to present the results?

### Learning Objectives

1. Review a few common performance metrics for categorical predictive tasks
2. Explore uncertainty in the context of machine learning models
3. Practice implementing and analyzing trained models 

### Session Timeline 

- Performance metrics Overview
- Uncertainty and model analysis
- Performance evaluation tutorial

### Follow up Exercises

- This week's assignment is to continue working on the final project
- At this point you should hopefully already have your final trained model!
- Try using a few of these approaches to characterize uncertainty in your results
- Get your presentation ready for next week!


### Office Hours 

If you have any further questions or wish to clarify anything discussed during the workshop, please reach out and schedule a slot during office hours to discuss.
