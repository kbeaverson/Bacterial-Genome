# Week 4 - Data Analysis & Visualization

Welcome to week 4 of Exploring the Bacterial Genome with Data Science! At this point we're going to start moving towards getting ready for modeling. Last week we had a detailed look through the data we collected to build our understanding of the steps we'll need to take to get it into a usable format.

This week we'll be leveraging that learning to reshape and transform our data from it's raw format into a consistent shape and size ready for use in ML models.

### Learning Objectives

1. Learn about three different featurization approaches for genomic data
2. Write code to process raw data into: gene counts, kmer counts and gene sequences
3. Understand the fundamental requirements of our features and some of the limitations and difficulties in compressing large sequencing data down to usable features
4. Build your own baseline model 

### Session Timeline 

- Featurization & Baseline Modeling 
- Exploratory Data Analysis Example
- Assignment: review correlations

### Follow up Exercises

- This week's'exercise allows you to build your own baseline model to compare against your final project
- Baseline modeling is important to build up context for your future results.
- In the of this exercise you'll review three baselines: random, majority and KNN
- The exercise is designed to take up to an hour to complete


### Office Hours 

If you have any further questions or wish to clarify anything discussed during the workshop, please reach out and schedule a slot during office hours to discuss.
