# Week 3 - Data Analysis & Visualization

Welcome to week 3 of Exploring the Bacterial Genome with Data Science! Now that we have the fundamental data we need to set out on our modeling journey - where should we start? If you're applying for Data Science roles and you recieve a take home exercise, this is often where you'll begin (as the data is often provided to you).

At this point of the project, things can feel the most intimidating. You now have this set of unknown data and it can often feel like you need to jump straight into building models or trying to solve the problem. What I would recommend is starting with a few common data exploration and visualization approaches to help you understand the data, help you formulate how you want to featurize and model the data and finally to allow you to summarize and present the data to others (e.g to demonstrate your understanding).

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the Data Science Process and where EDA fits into it
2. Review the Data we're working with, summarize it's basic characteristics
3. Understand how to review data quality and identify data which could negatively impact future modeling
4. Learn how to use matplotlib and seaborn to visualize key aspects of the data

### Session Timeline 

- EDA & Visualization Best Practices 
- Exploratory Data Analysis Example
- Assignment: review correlations

### Follow up Exercises

- This week's exercise further builds on the concepts of visualizing data
- In this case we're going to go a step further than where we left off in the workshop session and start to look at how features correlate to our target and to each other
- The exercise is designed to take up to an hour to complete


### Office Hours 

If you have any further questions or wish to clarify anything discussed during the workshop, please reach out and schedule a slot during office hours to discuss.
